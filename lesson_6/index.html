                    <p>Dionysus
                        God of wine, fruitfulness, parties, festivals, madness, chaos, drunkenness, vegetation, ecstasy,
                        and the theater. He is the twice-born son of Zeus and Semele, in that Zeus snatched him from his
                        mother's womb and stitched Dionysus into his own thigh and carried him until he was ready to be
                        born. In art he is depicted as either an older bearded god (particularly before 430 BC) or an
                        effeminate, long-haired youth (particularly after 430 BC). His attributes include the thyrsus, a
                        drinking cup, the grape vine, and a crown of ivy. He is often in the company of his thiasos, a
                        group of attendants including satyrs, maenads, and his old tutor Silenus. The consort of
                        Dionysus was Ariadne. It was once held that Dionysius was a later addition to the Greek
                        pantheon, but the discovery of Linear B tablets confirm his status as a deity from an early
                        period. Bacchus was another name for him in Greek, and came into common usage among the
                        Romans.[7] His sacred animals include dolphins, serpents, tigers, and donkeys.

                <div class="hermes">
                    <p>Hermes
                        God of boundaries, travel, trade, communication, language, writing, cunning and thieves. Hermes
                        was also responsible for protecting livestock and presided over the spheres associated with
                        fertility, music, luck, and deception.[9] The son of Zeus and Maia, Hermes is the messenger of
                        the gods, and a psychopomp who leads the souls of the dead into the afterlife. He was depicted
                        either as a handsome and athletic beardless youth, or as an older bearded man. His attributes
                        include the herald's wand or caduceus, winged sandals, and a traveler's cap. His sacred animals
                        include the tortoise. His Roman counterpart is Mercury.

                <div class="apollo">
                    <p>Apollo
                        God of music, arts, knowledge, healing, plague, prophecy, poetry, manly beauty, and archery. He
                        is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis. Both Apollo and Artemis use a bow
                        and arrow. Apollo is depicted as young, beardless, handsome and athletic. In myth, he can be
                        cruel and destructive, and his love affairs are rarely happy. He is often accompanied by the
                        Muses. His most famous temple is in Delphi, where he established his oracular shrine. His signs
                        and symbols include the laurel wreath, bow and arrow, and lyre. His sacred animals include roe
                        deer, swans, and pythons. Some late Roman and Greek poetry and mythography identifies him as a
                        sun-god, equivalent to Roman Sol and Greek Helios.[2]
